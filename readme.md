# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce

In this project I built out the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This app has full CRUD capability as you can CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE from this database.
